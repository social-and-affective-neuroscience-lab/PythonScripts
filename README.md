# Python Scripts

### Python scripts for in-person behavioral tasks

The tasks here are the certainty-movie-watching task and the social-non-social financial self-regulation task.
Additional files will be added for the scanner friendly version of the certainty task (need to change scale from vertical to horizontal).

((Also need to test out tubric joystick))
