## Card Task

In this localizer task (adapted from Mauricio Delgado), participants will be guessing if a card shown on screen will have a value less than 5 or greater than 5. They will press the '1' key or the '2' key to make their guesses. 

This task is programmed such that all participants end the task with $4.00. Tne $4.00 they earn will be used to fill the participants' money bank in the modified slot machine task.
