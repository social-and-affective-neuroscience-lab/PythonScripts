## Theory of Mind Localizer Task

In this task (adapted from Rebecca Saxe), participants will be reading short vignettes that target either false-belief (social) cognitions or false-photograph cognitions.
Participants are given a true/false statement following each vignette, and are prompted to use either the '1' or '2' key to respond 'true' or 'false', respectively.
