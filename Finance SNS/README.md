## Part of the moralizing self-regulation tasks

In this task, participants are prompted to type out social and non-social cues which are then used as primes in a regulatory decision-making paradigm.

This task is comprised of 20 blocks of 5 trials each (100 trials total). In each block, a cue is shown on screen while participants make a decision between allocating time for watching youtube videos and reading finance tips. 

At the end of the task, one trial is picked at random for participants to complete the activities in accordance with their selected allocation for that trial.
