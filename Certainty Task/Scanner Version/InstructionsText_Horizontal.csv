We ask that you update your assessments at any point where your feelings of certainty of the character's guilt/innocence changes. \n\nPress SPACE to continue."
"You can use the left joystick on the controller to indicate how certain you feel in your evaluation. Please push the joystick to the right to indicate feelings that the character is innocent and to the left to indicate feelings that the character is guilty.\n\nPushing the joystick further right or left indicates that you're feeling more certain of a character's innocence or guilt, respectively.\n\nPress SPACE to continue."
